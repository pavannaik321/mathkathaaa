          About Our Founder
        </h2>
        <p className="text-white leading-relaxed">
        Dr. Mahesh Udupa is an ambitious and empathetic educator who firmly believes that while there is no substitute for hard work, true wisdom lies in knowing where to invest oneâ€™s energy and time, especially in Mathematics. Having personally faced the challenges of mastering Mathematics and eventually overcoming them through a holistic approach, he now envisions sharing this journey with thousands, if not millions, of students who encounter similar struggles. Dr. Udupa believes that Mathematics is the most beautiful language of the Universe, and with the right approach, it can be made engaging, enjoyable, and accessible to all, contrary to common perception.
